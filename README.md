# ModularShip
This a game I am currently developing in processing with Fisica. 
It is a space shooter where the user has to destroy enemy ships and can steal what parts they drop to improve his/her own ship.
As of now there are no enemies but it is possible to add modules to your ship and test firing on targets, you can also throw your ship around! 
(this feature will be removed after enemies are added or moved to debug mode)

### How to run the code:
1. Download the project using the "download .zip" button on the Github page (make sure you use the main branch)
2. Make sure you have Processing 3 installed, if not go to [processing.org](https://processing.org/) and download it
3. Add the Fisica library with the ["add library" tool](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/How-to-Install-a-Contributed-Library
                                                        "instructions on how to use the add library tool")
4. Run the code with the Processing editor
5. Profit!
